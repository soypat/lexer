# lexer
Lexer patterns for parsing text.

Two lexer examples:
- [`lexers/pato`](lexers/pato): The most refined lexer pattern I've designed so far for building software that lexes structured text or programming languages
- [`lexers/pike`](lexers/pike): Lexer as described in Rob Pike's talk *Lexical Scanning in Go*
